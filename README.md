# Release List Enhanced

The Release List Enhanced is a React application designed to list and filter any Github repository releases. It leverages the Octokit REST API and various libraries such as `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`, `remark-github`, and `markdown-to-jsx` to fetch, format, and display the release notes from GitHub in a neat and accessible way.

You can check the App here: https://repo-release-list.vercel.app

> You'll need a Github Token to authenticate to the Github APIs. You can generate a new one in your Github's Developer settings.

To run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the application on your local server.

Navigate through the different releases and use the filter option to refine your results based on your needs. Enjoy!
